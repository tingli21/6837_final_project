Sarah Chieng 6.837 Assignment 3
• Compilation: Mac OS
• Collaboration: none
• References: none
• Known Problems/ Disclaimers: none
• Extra Credit: added wind to the cloth (can toggle on and off with "W" key)
• Comments: Inside SimulationApp, you have to comment out the code to render either the simple, pendulum, or cloth simulation.
By Default, the simple simulation is the one currently commented out. In the comments are also the recommended Integrator and step 
sizes that I used that I found worked. For the cloth interaction, pressing "r" resets the cloth. There is also a folder called "demos" with
photos and recordings of the three simulations. The photos I took weren't very good/didn't seem to depict much so I thought videos might
be better - I hope it's okay.
